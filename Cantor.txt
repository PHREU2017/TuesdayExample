Three things I liked:
1. The memes
2. The handout of all the commands - it was super helpful to have as a reference
3. That we all pushed a picture while still there.

Three things to improve:
1. Show as we go along how things work
2. Have us do the work as you do it within GitHub
3. The more memes the merrier
