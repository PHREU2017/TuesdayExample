Likes:
- Anna was a good speaker and presented the information well.
- The handout was informative and helped to enforce the specifics of the information.
- The presentation did a good job of touching on more advanced topics, but not confusing us with complicated stuff we wouldn't need immediately.

Criticism:
- The workshop could have been better organized so as to be a bit shorter and not cut into our other timeslots.
- Anna could have been more prepared beforehand, as there were a few specifics about the functionality that she was unsure about.
- It may have been a good idea to do the hands on part in tandem with the lecture, so we could see how what we were learning about worked practically and thereby grasp it better.
