Three Things I Liked
- I was able to learn a lot of the commands for GitHub
- I was able to get access to the ProHealth GitHub account
- I had a little time to practice using Github

Three Things to Improve
- I wished we had a little more time to go over using Github
- I wanted to go over more examples, like creating a folder in Github
- I would have liked to have heard more about the different capabilities of using Github in the terminal vs. online vs. on the desktop
