Three things I liked
1. I liked that you broke down the essence of GitHub and explained some of the terms we would encounter
2. That handout you gave us is awesome
3. I enjoyed having hands on time to work with GitHub. I appreciated all of the help that I received as well.
Three things I would improve
1. I would do a demo on the projector so we could all follow along and see what steps we need to take to complete the task
2. Maybe a youtube video that shows how to navigate GitHub (similar to point 1)
3. Maybe having a handout like the directions to creating this where there are screenshots we can follow to make it easier to get the hang of things.
