What I Thought of the GitHub Presentation

Likes:
1. Anna was willing to engage with us if we were having issues with GitHub.

2. Anna used diagrams to explain the structure of GitHub repositories and Branches in-depth.

3. The images were a nice bit of comedy and an occassional source of relaxation.

Dislikes:

1. Anna should not begin to panic if something goes wrong such as a technical glitch. She knows what she is doing and is capable of so the group basically trusts here.

2. Anna does not have to constantly reassure the students about the the amusement or concentration required for the presentation.

3. A part of the presentation on GitBash would have been a huge assist for those more comfortable with GitBash?
