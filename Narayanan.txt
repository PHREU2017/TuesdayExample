Three things I liked about today’s workshop were the diagrams in the presentation, the Git demo on the screen, and learning the meaning of various Git commands. Three things that could improve the experience for future REU students are increasing the amount of time spent teaching Git, drawing more pictures describing the Git commands on the whiteboard, and providing students with videos about Github before the workshop.
