1. I liked the use of memes.
2. I really liked having diagrams.
3. It was great how you explained the different terms; pretty easy to understand

Improvements
1. More time should be given for the actual interaction with GitHub
2. I would give students a folder before the session for homework with information in it already (maybe videos, fun crossoword puzzles).
3. I think it would be best if you went through it step by step with the group.
