Three Things I Liked
- You explained the general concept well
- Leaning GitHub now will help me in the future
- You were very patient with everyone, which was great

Three Things to Improve
- There needed to be more examples for both terminal and desktop GitHub use
- Time was really tight and it was frustrating that we didn't already have accounts ready
- I'm still terribly confused and I don't think I'm doing any of this correctly
